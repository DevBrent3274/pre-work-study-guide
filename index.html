        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Before any other elements, don't forget to define what type of information the browser is recieving - !DOCTYPE html</li>
          <li>Then set the language</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Put the meta data in your head and it is god practice to always have the basics that tell character set, screen sizes adjust and a title</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a webpage</li>
          <li>The base elemnet defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The meta element difines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords,author, and viewport</li>
          <li>The body element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the viewer.  All the content we want to display to the user must be inside the body  * body is a good example of a semantic HTML element where the name of the element describes its content and role it plays on a webpage - use them where possible to make your HTML easier to read!</li>
          <li>heading and paragraph elements are pretty intuitive</li>
          <li>The a element creates links</li>
          <li>The img element is used for images</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap and navigation, or you can just make a statement</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
   
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS makes it pretty</li>
          <li>It is where the information is set for the style of all the fonts, images, buttons and etc are desrcibed</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>box shadow uses an x and y acesss lited in that order where the x is width to the right and y is width to the bottom</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li></li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout moves the working branch to a new branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it - ex. git checkout -b feature/starter-code</li>
          <li>git add -A : The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
          <li>git commit -m creates a message that describes what the commit contains</li>
          <li>git commit creates a snap shot of currenlt staged changes</li>
          <li>typical flow: git pull origin main, git push origin :name of branch"</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>variables are just a named container where data is stored or pointed to</li>
          <li>var is the keyword and we use = to set it to value</li>
          <li>quotation marks denote a string and all strings are surrounded by quotation marks</li>
          <li>console.log is the function to output a message to the web console</li>
          <li>links for javascript go into the boby unlike css style that goes in the head</li>
          <li>remeber! - logically, code runs from the top of the page down to bottom</li>
          <li>=== is a stict equality operator and returns true or false</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way</li>
          <li>arrays are blocked by these brackets []</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>strings in arrays still need quotaions around them where as number and true/flase do not</li>
          <li>.length i a built in property that when used as an add on to a defined variable will automatically tell us the arrays length</li>
          <li>remember 0 is the first index(location) in an array and goes from there</li>
          <li>loops s a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times</li>
          <li>function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.   They are lines of code that you want to be able to call repeetedly when needed</li>
          <li>functions need () where the parameters or arrugument go</li>
